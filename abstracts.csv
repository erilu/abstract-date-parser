(#)Contributed equally","Purpose: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most
prevalent cancer in the world, accounting for more than 90% of head and neck
malignant tumors. However, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. To help
elucidate the potential mechanism of HNSCC tumorigenesis, we investigated the
gene interaction patterns associated with tumorigenesis.
Methods: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) can help us to
predict the intrinsic relationship or correlation between gene expression.
Additionally, we further explored the combination of clinical information and
module construction.
Results: Sixteen modules were constructed, among which the key module most
closely associated with clinical information was identified. By analyzing the
genes in this module, we found that the latter may be related to the immune
response, inflammatory response and formation of the tumor microenvironment.
Sixteen hub genes were identified-ARHGAP9, SASH3, CORO1A, ITGAL, PPP1R16B,
TBC1D10C, IL10RA, ITK, AKNA, PRKCB, TRAF3IP3, GIMAP4, CCR7, P2RY8, GIMAP7, and
SP140. We further validated these genes at the transcriptional and translation
levels.
Conclusion: The innovative use of a weighted network to analyze HNSCC samples
provides new insights into the molecular mechanism and prognosis of HNSCC.
Additionally, the hub genes we identified can be used as biomarkers and
therapeutic targets of HNSCC, laying the foundation for the accurate diagnosis
and treatment of HNSCC in clinical and research in the future.","DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S201177

interactions. Rare antigen-specific B cells must encounter antigen and
specialized systems are needed-unique to each lymphoid tissue type-to ensure this
happens efficiently. Lymphoid tissue barrier cells act to ensure that pathogens, 
while being permitted entry for B-cell recognition, are blocked from replication 
or dissemination. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells often need to be primed by
dendritic cells before supporting B-cell responses. For most responses,
antigen-specific helper T cells and B cells need to interact, first to initiate
clonal expansion and the plasmablast response, and later to support the germinal 
center (GC) response. Newly formed plasma cells need to travel to supportive
niches. GC B cells must become confined to the follicle center, organize into
dark and light zones, and interact with Tfh cells. Memory B cells need to be
positioned for rapid responses following reinfection. Each of these events
requires the actions of multiple G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their
ligands, including chemokines and lipid mediators. This review will focus on the 
guidance cue code underlying B-cell immunity, with an emphasis on findings from
our laboratory and on newer advances in related areas. We will discuss our recent
identification of geranylgeranyl-glutathione as a ligand for P2RY8. Our goal is
to provide the reader with a focused knowledge about the GPCRs guiding B-cell
responses and how they might be therapeutic targets, while also providing
examples of how multiple types of GPCRs can cooperate or act iteratively to
control cell behavior.",© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,"DOI: 10.1111/imr.12743

acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), the biological subtype of B-cell
precursor (BCP)-ALL defined by a distinct gene expression profile and the
presence of specific somatic aberrations including rearrangements of CRLF2. In
this study, we investigated whether rs3824662 in GATA3 associates with CRLF2
expression in leukemic cells and predicts prognosis in pediatric BCP-ALL patients
treated according to the ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (IC BFM)
2009 (n = 645) and the ALL IC BFM 2002 (n = 216) protocols. High expression of
CRLF2 was observed at both protein and mRNA levels (fourfold higher in AA than in
CA + CC) among GATA3 AA variant carriers, independent of the presence of
P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion. Additionally, the AA variant at rs3824662 was a significant
factor affecting minimal residual disease level at the end of induction phase and
overall survival regardless of the risk group and the protocol. The germline
variant at rs3824662 in GATA3 is a prognostic factor which associates with CRLF2 
expression in leukemic cells supporting the hypothesis that GATA3 may have a
regulatory effect on the CRLF2 pathway in pediatric BCP-ALL.","© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/gcc.22748

maturation, and are also a common origin of B cell malignancies. Despite being
made up of motile cells, germinal centres are tightly confined within B cell
follicles. The cues that promote this confinement are incompletely understood.
P2RY8 is a Gα13-coupled receptor that mediates the inhibition of migration and
regulates the growth of B cells in lymphoid tissues1,2. P2RY8 is frequently
mutated in germinal-centre B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) 
and Burkitt lymphoma1,3-6, and the ligand for this receptor has not yet been
identified. Here we perform a search for P2RY8 ligands and find P2RY8 bioactivity
in bile and in culture supernatants of several mouse and human cell lines. Using 
a seven-step biochemical fractionation procedure and a drop-out mass spectrometry
approach, we show that a previously undescribed biomolecule,
S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (GGG), is a potent P2RY8 ligand that is detectable
in lymphoid tissues at the nanomolar level. GGG inhibited the chemokine-mediated 
migration of human germinal-centre B cells and T follicular helper cells, and
antagonized the induction of phosphorylated AKT in germinal-centre B cells. We
also found that the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase-5 (GGT5), which was highly
expressed by follicular dendritic cells, metabolized GGG to a form that did not
activate the receptor. Overexpression of GGT5 disrupted the ability of P2RY8 to
promote B cell confinement to germinal centres, which indicates that GGT5
establishes a GGG gradient in lymphoid tissues. This work defines GGG as an
intercellular signalling molecule that is involved in organizing and controlling 
germinal-centre responses. As the P2RY8 locus is modified in several other types 
of cancer in addition to GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma, we speculate that GGG
might have organizing and growth-regulatory roles in multiple human tissues.","DOI: 10.1038/s41586-019-1003-z

5-15% of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). We have
previously reported the genomic landscape of patients with CRLF2 rearrangements
(CRLF2-r) using both whole genome and exome sequencing, which identified a number
of potential clonal and sub-clonal genomic alterations. In this study, we aimed
to assess when the CRLF2-r; IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2, arose during the evolution 
of both Down syndrome-ALL (DS-ALL) and non-DS-ALL. Using fluorescence in situ
hybridisation, we were able to track up to four structural variants in single
cells from 47 CRLF2-r B-ALL patients, which in association with our multiplex
single-cell analysis of a further four patients, permitted simultaneous tracking 
of copy number alterations, structural and single nucleotide variants within
individual cells. We observed CRLF2-r arising as both early and late events in DS
and non-DS-ALL patients. Parallel evolution of discrete clones was observed in
the development of CRLF2-r B-ALL, either involving the CRLF2-r or one of the
other tracked abnormalities. In-depth single-cell analysis identified both linear
and branching evolution with early clones harbouring a multitude of

Findings: Clinker is a bioinformatics tool written in Python, R, and Bpipe that
leverages the superTranscript method to visualize fusion genes. We demonstrate
the use of Clinker to obtain interpretable visualizations of the RNA-seq data
that lead to fusion calls. In addition, we use Clinker to explore multiple fusion

lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines. First, we performed multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis to identify copy number
abnormalities (CNAs) in eight genes associated with B-ALL according to genetic
subtype. In Ph+ B-ALL cell lines, the frequencies of IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B, BTG1, and 
PAX5 deletion were significantly higher than those in Ph- B-ALL cell lines. The
frequency of CDKN2A/2B deletion in KMT2A rearranged cell lines was significantly 
lower than that in non-KMT2A rearranged cell lines. These findings suggest that
CNAs are correlated with genetic subtype in B-ALL cell lines. In addition, we
determined that three B-other ALL cell lines had IKZF1 deletions (YCUB-5, KOPN49,
and KOPN75); we therefore performed comprehensive genetic analysis of these cell 
lines. YCUB-5, KOPN49, and KOPN75 had P2RY8-CRLF2, IgH-CRLF2, and PAX5-ETV6

had JAK2 R683I and KRAS G12D, and KOPN49 had JAK2 R683G and KRAS G13D mutations.

treated very intensively. However, most patients who eventually relapse have
standard or medium risk ALL with low minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. We
analysed recurrent microdeletions and other clinical prognostic factors in a
cohort of 475 uniformly treated non-high risk precursor B-cell ALL patients with 
the aim of better predicting relapse and refining risk stratification. Lower
relapse-free survival at 7 years (RFS) was associated with IKZF1 intragenic

created a predictive model based on a risk score (RS) for deletions, MRD and NCI 
risk, extending from an RS of 0 (RS0) for patients with no unfavourable factors
to RS2 +  for patients with 2 or 3 high risk factors. RS0, RS1, and RS2 +  groups
had RFS of 93%, 78% and 49%, respectively, and overall survival (OS) of 99%, 91%

lineage and myeloperoxidase positivity. A P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion and JAK1 mutation
were detected, both of which are associated with Ph-like features.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of Ph-like MPAL, which
may represent a new diagnostic entity. We emphasize the need for refinement of
diagnostic criteria for MPALs and highlight an opportunity for expansion of
inclusion criteria in ongoing clinical trials studying the use of tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapy to include cases of Ph-like MPAL.","© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017. All rights reserved. For

sub-type characterized by a signaling profile similar to Ph + ALL, however
accumulating evidence indicates genetic heterogeneity within CRLF2-r ALL. We
performed thorough genomic characterization of 35 CRLF2-r cases (P2RY8-CRLF2
n = 18; IGH-CRLF2 n = 17). Activating JAK2 mutations were present in 34% of
patients, and a CRLF2-F232C mutation was identified in an additional 17%. IKZF1
deletions were detected in 63% of cases. The majority of patients (26/35)
classified as Ph-like, and these were characterized by significantly higher
levels of MUC4, GPR110 and IL2RA/CD25. In addition, Ph-like CRLF2-r samples were 
significantly enriched for IKZF1 deletions, JAK2/CRLF2 mutations and increased
expression of JAK/STAT target genes (CISH, SOCS1), suggesting that
mutation-driven CRLF2/JAK2 activation is more frequent in this sub-group. Less is
known about the genomics of CRLF2-r cases lacking JAK2-pathway mutations, but
KRAS/NRAS mutations were identified in 4/9 non-Ph-like samples. This work
highlights the heterogeneity of secondary lesions which may arise and influence
intracellular-pathway activation in CRLF2-r patients, and importantly presents
distinct therapeutic targets within a group of patients harboring identical
primary translocations, for whom efficient directed therapies are currently
lacking.",Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2017.08.034

pediatric cancer patients were evaluated for copy number alterations (CNAs)
associated with gene fusions. Karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization
studies were performed in 42% of the patients. Ten percent of the bone marrow or

RUNX1T1-RUNX1 fusions were detected in the bone marrow samples. The most common
alteration among the low-grade gliomas was a 7q34 tandem duplication resulting in
a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Additional fusions identified in the pediatric brain
tumors included FAM131B-BRAF and RAF1-QKI. COL1A1-PDGFB, CRTC1-MAML2, EWSR1,
HEY1, PAX3- and PAX7-FOXO1, and PLAG1 fusions were determined in a variety of
solid tumors and a novel potential gene fusion, FGFR1-USP6, was detected in an
aneurysmal bone cyst. The identification of these gene fusions was instrumental
in tumor diagnosis. In contrast to hematologic and solid tumors in adults that
are predominantly driven by mutations, the majority of hematologic and solid

high-risk subtype characterized by genomic alterations that activate cytokine
receptor and kinase signaling. We examined the frequency and spectrum of
targetable genetic lesions in a retrospective cohort of 1389 consecutively
diagnosed patients with childhood B-lineage ALL with high-risk clinical features 
and/or elevated minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction
therapy. The Ph-like gene expression profile was identified in 341 of 1389
patients, 57 of whom were excluded from additional analyses because of the
presence of BCR-ABL1 (n = 46) or ETV6-RUNX1 (n = 11). Among the remaining 284
patients (20.4%), overexpression and rearrangement of CRLF2 (IGH-CRLF2 or
P2RY8-CRLF2) were identified in 124 (43.7%), with concomitant genomic alterations
activating the JAK-STAT pathway (JAK1, JAK2, IL7R) identified in 63 patients
(50.8% of those with CRLF2 rearrangement). Among the remaining patients, using
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or transcriptome sequencing, we
identified targetable ABL-class fusions (ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB) in 14.1%,
EPOR rearrangements or JAK2 fusions in 8.8%, alterations activating other
JAK-STAT signaling genes (IL7R, SH2B3, JAK1) in 6.3% or other kinases (FLT3,
NTRK3, LYN) in 4.6%, and mutations involving the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, NF1,
PTPN11) in 6% of those with Ph-like ALL. We identified 8 new rearrangement
partners for 4 kinase genes previously reported to be rearranged in Ph-like ALL.

(ALL) is distinguishable from other ALL subtypes by CD27pos /CD44low-neg
immunophenotype. During diagnostic immunophenotyping of 573 childhood B-cell
precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), we identified eight cases with this immunophenotype
among ""B-other ALL"" (BCP-ALL cases negative for routinely tested
chromosomal/genetic aberrations). We aimed to elucidate whether these cases
belong to the recently described ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL defined by the
ETV6/RUNX1-specific gene expression profile (GEP), harboring concurrent ETV6 and 
IKZF1 lesions. We performed comprehensive genomic analysis using single
nucleotide polymorphism arrays, whole exome and transcriptome sequencing and GEP 
on microarrays. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on GEP, five out of
seven analyzed CD27pos /CD44low-neg B-other cases clustered with
ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL and were thus classified as ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL. The two 
cases clustering outside ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL harbored a P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion
with activating JAK2 mutations and a TCF3/ZNF384 fusion, respectively, assigning 
them to other ALL subtypes. All five ETV6/RUNX1-like cases harbored ETV6
deletions; uniform intragenic ARPP21 deletions and various IKZF1 lesions were
each found in three ETV6/RUNX1-like cases. The frequency of ETV6 and ARPP21
deletions was significantly higher in ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL compared with a
reference cohort of 42 B-other ALL. In conclusion, we show that ETV6/RUNX1-like
ALL is associated with CD27pos /CD44low-neg immunophenotype and identify ARPP21
deletions to contribute to its specific genomic profile enriched for ETV6 and
IKZF1 lesions. In conjunction with previously published data, our study
identifies the ETV6 lesion as the only common genetic aberration and thus the
most likely key driver of ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL.","© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/gcc.22464

B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL) and can be caused by different
genetic aberrations. The presence of the most frequent alteration, the
P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion, was shown to be associated with a high relapse incidence in
children treated according to ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) protocols, which
is poorly understood. Moreover, the frequency of other alterations has not been
systematically analyzed yet.
PROCEDURE: CRLF2 mRNA expression and potential genetic aberrations causing a
CRLF2 high expression were prospectively assessed in 1,105 patients treated
according to the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica
(AIEOP)-BFM ALL 2009 protocol. Additionally, we determined copy number
alterations in selected B-cell differentiation genes for all CRLF2
high-expressing pB-ALL cases, as well as JAK2 and CRLF2 mutations.
RESULTS: A CRLF2 high expression was detected in 26/178 (15%) T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, 21 of them (81%) had been stratified as
high-risk patients by treatment response. In pB-ALL, a CRLF2 high expression was 
determined in 91/927 (10%) cases; the P2RY8/CRLF2 rearrangement in 44/91 (48%) of
them, supernumerary copies of CRLF2 in 18/91 (20%), and, notably, the IGH/CRLF2
translocation was detected in 16/91 (18%). Remarkably, 7 of 16 (44%) patients
with IGH/CRLF2 translocation had already relapsed. P2RY8/CRLF2- and
IGH/CRLF2-positive samples (70 and 94%, respectively) were characterized by a
high frequency of additional deletions in B-cell differentiation genes such as
IKZF1 or PAX5.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that this high frequency of genetic aberrations in
the context of a high CRLF2 expression could contribute to the high risk of
relapse in P2RY8/CRLF2- and IGH/CRLF2-positive ALL.","© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/pbc.26539

determine the clinical and genetic landscape of those with IGH-CRLF2 or
P2RY8-CRLF2 (CRLF2-r) using multiple genomic approaches. Clinical and demographic
features of CRLF2-r patients were characteristic of B-ALL. Patients with
IGH-CRLF2 were older (14 y vs. 4 y, P < .001), while the incidence of CRLF2-r
among Down syndrome patients was high (50/161, 31%). CRLF2-r co-occurred with
primary chromosomal rearrangements but the majority (111/161, 69%) had B-other
ALL. Copy number alteration (CNA) profiles were similar to B-other ALL, although 
CRLF2-r patients harbored higher frequencies of IKZF1 (60/138, 43% vs. 77/1351,
24%) and BTG1 deletions (20/138, 15% vs. 3/1351, 1%). There were significant
differences in CNA profiles between IGH-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2 patients: IKZF1
(25/35, 71% vs. 36/108, 33%, P < .001), BTG1 (11/35, 31% vs. 10/108, 9%, P

fusion, USP9X-DDX3X, was discovered in 10/54 (19%) of patients. Pathway analysis 
of the mutational profile revealed novel involvement for focal adhesion. Although
the functional relevance of many of these abnormalities are unknown, they likely

malignancy. A subset of patients experience an increased mortality rate driven by
two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early
progression after immunochemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading
to these clinical end points is poorly understood, and previously determined
genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or
accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge 
of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated
mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology
over the time course of FL clinical histories.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted
deep sequencing, and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse
specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in 15 transformation 
cases and 6 progression cases, and measured the change in clonal population
abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in 
transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were
generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens,
consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the
transformation specimens. This pattern was independent of time to transformation 
and treatment modality. By contrast, early progression specimens were composed of
clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only
moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immunochemotherapy. Analysis of
somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in an extension cohort
consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted
biology in the two clinical end points. We found 12 genes that were more commonly
mutated in transformed samples than in the preceding FL tumors, including TP53,
B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2, and P2RY8. Moreover, ten genes were more commonly
mutated in diagnostic specimens of patients with early progression, including
TP53, BTG1, MKI67, and XBP1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the
clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implications for 
interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced
selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will
require different clinical management strategies.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002197

relapse risk. Their mutational and transcriptional landscape, as well as the
respective patterns at relapse remain largely elusive. We, therefore, performed
an integrated analysis of whole-exome and RNA sequencing in 41 major clone
fusion-positive cases including 19 matched diagnosis/relapse pairs. We detected a
variety of frequently subclonal and highly instable JAK/STAT but also RTK/Ras
pathway-activating mutations in 76% of cases at diagnosis and virtually all
relapses. Unlike P2RY8-CRLF2 that was lost in 32% of relapses, all other genomic 
alterations affecting lymphoid development (58%) and cell cycle (39%) remained
stable. Only IKZF1 alterations predominated in relapsing cases (P=0.001) and
increased from initially 36 to 58% in matched cases. IKZF1's critical role is
further corroborated by its specific transcriptional signature comprising stem
cell features with signs of impaired lymphoid differentiation, enhanced focal
adhesion, activated hypoxia pathway, deregulated cell cycle and increased drug
resistance. Our findings support the notion that P2RY8-CRLF2 is dispensable for
relapse development and instead highlight the prominent rank of IKZF1 for relapse
development by mediating self-renewal and homing to the bone marrow niche.
Consequently, reverting aberrant IKAROS signaling or its disparate programs

of high-risk B-cell ALL characterized by formation of abnormal gene fusions
involving tyrosine kinase (TK) and cytokine receptor genes and activation of TK
signaling. Because of the diversity of associated genetic changes, the detection 
of Ph-like ALL cases currently requires multiple cytogenetic and molecular
assays; thus, our goal was to develop a consolidated workflow for detecting
genetic abnormalities in Ph-like ALL. We found that total and targeted RNA
sequencing (RNAseq)-based approach allowed the detection of abnormal fusion
transcripts (EBF1-PDGFRB, P2RY8-CRLF2, RCSD1-ABL1, and RCSD1-ABL2). The
bioinformatics algorithm accurately detected the fusion transcripts without prior
input about possible events. Additionally, we showed that RNAseq analysis enabled
evaluation for disease-associated sequence variants in expressed transcripts.
While total RNAseq can be a second tier approach allowing discovery of novel
genetic alterations, the targeted RNAseq workflow offers a clinically applicable 
method for the detection of fusion transcripts.","DOI: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1219902

and a relapsing course is observed in most patients. Although the development of 
genomic technologies has greatly improved our understanding of MM pathogenesis,
the mechanisms underlying relapse have been less thoroughly investigated. In this
study, an integrative analysis of DNA copy number, DNA methylation and gene
expression was conducted in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from MM
patients. Overall, the acquisition of abnormalities at relapse was much more
frequent than the loss of lesions present at diagnosis, and DNA losses were
significantly more frequent in relapse than in diagnosis samples. Interestingly, 
copy number abnormalities involving more than 100 Mb of DNA at relapse
significantly affect the gene expression of these samples, provoking a particular
deregulation of the IL-8 pathway. On the other hand, no significant modifications
of gene expression were observed in those samples with less than 100 Mb affected 
by chromosomal changes. Although several statistical approaches were used to
identify genes whose abnormal expression at relapse was regulated by methylation,
only two genes that were significantly deregulated in relapse samples (SORL1 and 
GLT1D1) showed a negative correlation between methylation and expression. Further
analysis revealed that DNA methylation was involved in regulating SORL1
expression in MM. Finally, relevant changes in gene expression observed in
relapse samples, such us downregulation of CD27 and P2RY8, were most likely not
preceded by alterations in the corresponding DNA. Taken together, these results
suggest that the genomic heterogeneity described at diagnosis remains at relapse.","DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.13025

B-cell development. Aberrations in CRLF2 activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway 
that contributes to B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The prognostic
significance of CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in various B-ALL risk
subgroups has not been well established. Two hundred seventy-one patients with
newly diagnosed childhood B-ALL were enrolled from a Chinese population. The
prevalence of CRLF2 overexpression, CRLF2-P2RY8 fusion, CRLF2 F232C mutation, and
JAK2 and IL7R mutational status were analyzed, and the prognostic impact of CRLF2
overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 on B-ALL was evaluated by assessing their
influence on overall survival and event-free survival. CRLF2 overexpression and
P2RY8-CRLF2 were found in 19% and 10%, respectively, in the whole cohort. No
correlation between CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 was observed. CRLF2
F322C and IL7R mutations were not detected in B-ALL cases overexpressing CRLF2,
and no JAK2 mutations were found in the whole cohort either. The results showed
that CRLF2 overexpression and P2RY8-CRLF2 were associated with a poor outcome in 
unselected B-ALL. Moreover, in an intermediate risk B-ALL subgroup P2RY8-CRLF2
was correlated with worse survival, whereas in high- and low-risk subgroups,
CRLF2 overexpression predicted a poor outcome. Our findings suggest that
P2RY8-CRLF2 is an independent prognostic indicator in intermediate risk B-ALL,
while CRLF2 overexpression is correlated with an inferior outcome in high- or
low-risk B-ALL. Our study demonstrates that the impact of P2RY8-CRLF2 and CRLF2
overexpression on B-ALL survival may differ across risk subgroups. © 2016 Wiley

traditional cytogenetic analysis. We integrated cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism array results from
60 consecutive clinical ALL cases. By cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ
hybridization analyses, recurring abnormalities with clinical relevance were
observed in 33 B-cell ALL (B-ALL), including t(9;22), hyperdiploidy, KMT2A
translocation, ETV6-RUNX1, intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, near 
haploidy or low hypodiploidy, and t(8;22). Single-nucleotide polymorphism array
analysis found additional aberrations with prognostic or therapeutic implication 
in 21 B-ALL and two T-cell ALL, including IKZF1 deletion, intrachromosomal
amplification of chromosome 21 (one case with a normal karyotype), low
hypodiploidy (two cases with a normal karyotype), and one case each with fusion
genes ETV6-NTRK3, CRLF2-P2RY8, NUP214-ABL1, and SET-NUP214. IKZF1 deletion was
noted in nine B-ALL with t(9;22), one B-ALL with t(4;11), five B-ALL with a
normal karyotype, and three B-ALL with nonrecurring karyotypic abnormalities.
Combining single-nucleotide polymorphism array with chromosome and fluorescence

acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes (B-NEG ALL). While
the role of d-CRLF2 in children has been extensively described, little is known
about its role and impact in adult ALL.
METHODS: Expression levels of CRLF2 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR 
in 102 newly-diagnosed adult B-NEG ALL and correlated with the clinico-biological
characteristics and outcome. Incidence and clinical impact of the P2RY8/CRLF2
transcript was also assessed.
RESULTS: High CRLF2 levels, as continuous variable, were significantly associated
with hyperleucocytosis (p=0.0002) and thrombocytopenia (p=0.005); when a
cut-point at ΔCt≤8 was applied, 35 cases (34.3%), mostly males (80%), proved
positive for CRLF2 expression. High CRLF2 levels, as continuous or categorical
variable, were associated with a worse disease-free (p=0.003 and p=0.015) and
overall survival (p=0.017 and 0.0038). Furthermore, when CRLF2 was analyzed as a 
categorical variable, a high statistical association was found with IKZF1
deletion and mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway (p=0.001 and p<0.0001,
respectively). Finally, the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript, identified in 8/102 patients 
(7.8%), was associated with a poor outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: In adult B-NEG ALL, high CRLF2 expression is associated with
distinct clinico-biological features and an unfavourable prognosis in both
univariate and multivariate analysis; similarly, P2RY8/CRLF2 positivity
correlates with a poor outcome. The quantification of CRLF2 is an important
prognostic marker in adult B-lineage ALL without known genetic lesions.",Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,"DOI: 10.1016/j.leukres.2015.11.018

that egress of Gna13 mutant GC B cells from lymph nodes in the mouse depends on
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3. These findings provide evidence that FDCs
promote GC confinement of both human and mouse GC B cells via Gα13-dependent
pathways, and they show that dissemination of Gα13-deficient GC B cells

hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a MHC-linked disorder of iron overload. Both
environmental and genetic components are known to influence CD8+ T-lymphocyte
homeostasis but the role of the HH associated protein HFE is still insufficiently
understood. Genome-wide expression profiling was performed in peripheral blood
CD8+ T lymphocytes from HH patients selected according to CD8+ T-lymphocyte
numbers and from Hfe-/- mice maintained either under normal or high iron diet
conditions. In addition, T-lymphocyte apoptosis and cell cycle progression were
analyzed by flow cytometry in HH patients. HH patients with low CD8+ T-lymphocyte
numbers show a differential expression of genes related to lymphocyte
differentiation and maturation namely CCR7, LEF1, ACTN1, NAA50, P2RY8 and FOSL2, 
whose expression correlates with the relative proportions of naïve, central and
effector memory subsets. In addition, expression levels of LEF1 and P2RY8 in
memory cells as well as the proportions of CD8+ T cells in G2/M cell cycle phase 
are significantly different in HH patients compared to controls. Hfe-/- mice do
not show alterations in CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers but differential gene response 
patterns. We found an increased expression of S100a8 and S100a9 that is most
pronounced in high iron diet conditions. Similarly, CD8+ T lymphocytes from HH
patients display higher S100a9 expression both at the mRNA and protein level.
Altogether, our results support a role for HFE as a negative regulator of CD8+
T-lymphocyte activation. While the activation markers S100a8 and S100a9 are
strongly increased in CD8+ T cells from both, Hfe-/- mice and HH patients, a
differential profile of genes related to differentiation/maturation of CD8+ T
memory cells is evident in HH patients only. This supports the notion that HFE
contributes, at least in part, to the generation of low peripheral blood CD8+ T
lymphocytes in HH.","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0124246

malignancy, yet the signalling pathways that are deregulated and the factors
leading to its systemic dissemination are poorly defined. Work in mice showed
that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2 (S1PR2), a Gα12 and Gα13 coupled
receptor, promotes growth regulation and local confinement of germinal centre B
cells. Recent deep sequencing studies of GCB-DLBCL have revealed mutations in
many genes in this cancer, including in GNA13 (encoding Gα13) and S1PR2 (refs
5,6, 7). Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo assays, that
GCB-DLBCL-associated mutations occurring in S1PR2 frequently disrupt the
receptor's Akt and migration inhibitory functions. Gα13-deficient mouse germinal 
centre B cells and human GCB-DLBCL cells were unable to suppress pAkt and
migration in response to S1P, and Gα13-deficient mice developed germinal centre
B-cell-derived lymphoma. Germinal centre B cells, unlike most lymphocytes, are
tightly confined in lymphoid organs and do not recirculate. Remarkably,
deficiency in Gα13, but not S1PR2, led to germinal centre B-cell dissemination
into lymph and blood. GCB-DLBCL cell lines frequently carried mutations in the
Gα13 effector ARHGEF1, and Arhgef1 deficiency also led to germinal centre B-cell 
dissemination. The incomplete phenocopy of Gα13- and S1PR2 deficiency led us to
discover that P2RY8, an orphan receptor that is mutated in GCB-DLBCL and another 
germinal centre B-cell-derived malignancy, Burkitt's lymphoma, also represses
germinal centre B-cell growth and promotes confinement via Gα13. These findings
identify a Gα13-dependent pathway that exerts dual actions in suppressing growth 
and blocking dissemination of germinal centre B cells that is frequently
disrupted in germinal centre B-cell-derived lymphoma.","DOI: 10.1038/nature13765

poorer survival and more relapses than non-DS children with ALL, highlighting an 
urgent need for deeper mechanistic understanding of DS-ALL. Here, using
full-exome or cancer genes-targeted sequencing of 42 ALL samples from 39 DS
patients, we uncover driver mutations in RAS, (KRAS and NRAS) recurring to a
similar extent (15/42) as JAK2 (12/42) mutations or P2RY8-CRLF2 fusions (14/42). 
RAS mutations are almost completely mutually exclusive with JAK2 mutations
(P=0.016), driving a combined total of two-thirds of analysed cases. Clonal
architecture analysis reveals that both RAS and JAK2 drove sub-clonal expansions 
primarily initiated by CRLF2 rearrangements, and/or mutations in chromatin
remodellers and lymphocyte differentiation factors. Remarkably, in 2/3 relapsed
cases, there is a switch from a primary JAK2- or PTPN11-mutated sub-clone to a
RAS-mutated sub-clone in relapse. These results provide important new insights

are identified in approximately 50-60% of patients with Down syndrome-associated 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS-ALL), and this pathway is considered a potential
therapeutic target. The frequency of BTG1 deletions in DS-ALL is controversial.
IKZF1 deletions, found in 20-30% of DS-ALL patients, are associated with a poor
outcome and EBF1 deletions are very rare (∼2%). We analyzed 38 patients to
determine the frequencies and clinical implications of CRLF2-JAK pathway genetic 
alterations and recurrent gene deletions in Japanese DS-ALL patients. We
confirmed a high incidence of P2RY8-CRLF2 (29%) and JAK2 mutations (16%), though 
the frequency of P2RY8-CRLF2 was slightly lower than that in Western countries
(∼50%). BTG1 deletions were common in our cohort (25%). IKZF1 deletions were
detected in 25% of patients and associated with shorter overall survival (OS).
EBF1 deletions were found at an unexpectedly high frequency (16%), and at a
significantly higher level in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients than in
P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (44% vs. 4%, P=0.015). Deletions of CDKN2A/B and
PAX5 were common in P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (48 and 39%, respectively) but 
not in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients (11% each). Associations between these
genetic alterations and clinical characteristics were not observed except for
inferior OS in patients with IKZF1 deletions. These results suggest that
differences exist between the genetic profiles of DS-ALL patients in Japan and in
Western countries, and that P2RY8-CRLF2 and EBF1 deletions may cooperate in
leukemogenesis in a subset of Japanese DS-ALL patients.","© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/gcc.22201

discovery. In this study, we used TaqMan Low Density Arrays to profile the full
GPCR repertoire of primary human macrophages differentiated from monocytes using 
either colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1/M-CSF) (CSF-1 Mϕ) or granulocyte
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (GM-CSF Mϕ). The overall trend was 
a downregulation of GPCRs during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, but a
core set of 10 genes (e.g. LGR4, MRGPRF and GPR143) encoding seven transmembrane 
proteins were upregulated, irrespective of the differentiating agent used.
Several of these upregulated GPCRs have not previously been studied in the
context of macrophage biology and/or inflammation. As expected, CSF-1 Mϕ and
GM-CSF Mϕ exhibited differential inflammatory cytokine profiles in response to
the Toll-like Receptor (TLR)4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, 15
GPCRs were differentially expressed between these cell populations in the basal
state. For example, EDG1 was expressed at elevated levels in CSF-1 Mϕ versus
GM-CSF Mϕ, whereas the reverse was true for EDG6. 101 GPCRs showed differential
regulation over an LPS time course, with 65 of these profiles being impacted by
the basal differentiation state (e.g. GPRC5A, GPRC5B). Only 14 LPS-regulated
GPCRs showed asynchronous behavior (divergent LPS regulation) with respect to
differentiation status. Thus, the differentiation state primarily affects the
magnitude of LPS-regulated expression, rather than causing major reprogramming of
GPCR gene expression profiles. Several GPCRs showing differential profiles
between CSF-1 Mϕ and GM-CSF Mϕ (e.g. P2RY8, GPR92, EMR3) have not been widely
investigated in macrophage biology and inflammation. Strikingly, several closely 
related GPCRs displayed completely opposing patterns of regulation during
differentiation and/or activation (e.g. EDG1 versus EDG6, LGR4 versus LGR7,
GPRC5A versus GPRC5B). We propose that selective regulation of GPCR5A and GPCR5B 
in CSF-1 Mϕ contributes to skewing toward the M2 macrophage phenotype. Our
analysis of the GPCR repertoire expressed during primary human monocyte to
macrophage differentiation and TLR4-mediated activation provides a valuable new
platform for conducting future functional analyses of individual GPCRs in human

translocations (IGH@-t), and deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1,
and EBF1 in adolescents and adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 454 patients (age 15 to 60 years old) 
treated on the multicenter United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Trial
XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2993 trial (UKALLXII/ECOG2993) with
Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor ALL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to detect these
genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (5%) had CRLF2-d (P2RY8-CRLF2, n = 7; IGH@-CRLF2, n =
13), and 36 patients (8%) harbored an IGH@-t with a different partner gene. There
was little overlap between IGH@-t, CRLF2-d, and established chromosomal
abnormalities. Deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, or EBF1 were 
prevalent with 101 (33%) of 304 patients harboring one and 102 (33%) harboring
two or more alterations, occurring with varying frequency in all cytogenetic
subgroups. The 5-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and
overall survival (OS) rates for the whole cohort were 40%, 55%, and 43%,
respectively. Patients with CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions were associated 
with an inferior outcome in univariate but not multivariate analysis. In
particular, CRLF2-d patients had a lower RFS compared with other patients (30%), 
whereas those with IGH@-t or IKZF1 deletions had a lower OS (27% and 35%,
respectively).
CONCLUSION: CRLF2-d and IGH@-t represent distinct subtypes of adolescent and
adult ALL. Deletions of key B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes
are highly prevalent but vary in frequency by cytogenetic subgroup. CRLF2-d,
IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions are associated with poor outcome in adolescent and

analyzed the prognostic impact of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2)
over-expression and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in 464 BCP-ALL patients (not affected by
Down syndrome and BCR-ABL negative) enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study in

higher than the overall median). P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was detected in 22/365 (6%)
cases, with 10/22 cases also showing CRLF2 over-expression. P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion
was the most relevant prognostic factor independent of CRLF2 over-expression with
a threefold increase in risk of relapse. Significantly, the cumulative incidence 
of relapse of the P2RY8-CRLF2 + patients in the IR group was high (61.1% ± 12.9

we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor
samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified
recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in
DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic
mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously
suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and
TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with
BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring
at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely
caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated somatic hypermutation,
as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target
motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside 
of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong
negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by
using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but
infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of
DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the
landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new

differences in abnormality patterns between such cases and acute leukemias in
general. Also, certain molecular genetic aberrations characterize DS-related
leukemias, such as GATA1 mutations in ML-DS and deregulation of the CRLF2 gene in
DS-ALL. Whether microdeletions/microduplications also vary between DS and non-DS 
cases is presently unclear. To address this issue, we performed single nucleotide
polymorphism array analyses of eight pediatric ML-DS and 17 B-cell precursor
DS-ALL. In the ML-DS cases, a total of 29 imbalances (20 gains and nine losses)
and two partial uniparental isodisomies (pUPDs) were detected. None of the 11
small (defined as <10 Mb) imbalances were recurrent, nor were the pUPDs, whereas 
of the 18 large aberrations, three were recurrent-dup(1q), +8 and +21. In
contrast, several frequent changes were identified in the DS-ALL cases, which
harbored 82 imbalances (30 gains and 52 losses) and four pUPDs. Of the 40 large
changes, 28 were gains and 12 losses, with +X, dup(Xq), dup(1q), del(7p),
dup(8q), del(9p), dup(9p), del(12p), dup(17q), and +21 being recurrent. Of the 40
microdeletions identified, several targeted specific genes, with the following
being repeatedly deleted: BTG1 and CDKN2A/B (29% of cases), ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5 and
SERP2 (18%), and BTLA, INPP4B, P2RY8, and RB1 (12%). Loss of the SERP2 and INPP4B
genes, encoding the stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member
2 and the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-II, respectively, has previously
never been implicated in leukemia. Although deletions of the other genes have
been associated with ALL, the high frequency of BTG1 loss is a novel finding.
Such deletions may characterize a clinical subgroup of DS-ALL, comprising mainly 
boys with a high median age. In conclusion, ML-DS and DS-ALL are genetically
distinct, with mainly gains in ML-DS and deletions in DS-ALL. Furthermore, DS-ALL
is characterized by several recurrent gene deletions, with BTG1 loss being
particularly frequent.","Copyright © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","DOI: 10.1002/gcc.20944

diagnosis and risk stratification, the initiating genetic events need to be
elucidated. To investigate the genetic basis of BCP-ALL, genomes of 94 iAMP21
patients were interrogated by arrays, FISH, and multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification. Most copy number alterations targeted chromosome 21,
reinforcing the complexity of this chromosome. The common region of amplification
on chromosome 21 was refined to a 5.1-mb region that included RUNX1, miR-802, and
genes mapping to the Down syndrome critical region. Recurrent abnormalities
affecting genes in key pathways were identified: IKZF1 (22%), CDKN2A/B (17%),
PAX5 (8%), ETV6 (19%), and RB1 (37%). Investigation of clonal architecture
provided evidence that these abnormalities, and P2RY8-CRLF2, were secondary to
chromosome 21 rearrangements. Patient outcome was uniformly poor with standard
therapy irrespective of the presence or absence of these changes. This study has 
provided evidence that chromosome 21 instability is the only anomaly among those

52 (6%) had CRLF2-d, but it was more prevalent among Down syndrome patients
(54%). P2RY8-CRLF2 (n = 43) was more frequent than IGH@-CRLF2 (n = 9). CRLF2-d
was not associated with age, sex, or white cell count, but IGH@-CRLF2 patients
were older than P2RY8-CRLF2 patients (median 8 vs 4 years, P = .0017). Patients
with CRLF2-d were more likely to present with enlarged livers and spleens (38% vs
18%, P < .001). CRLF2-d was not seen in conjunction with established chromosomal 
translocations but 6 (12%) cases had high hyperdiploidy, and 5 (10%) had iAMP21. 
Univariate analysis suggested that CRLF2-d was associated with an inferior
outcome: (event-free survival [EFS] hazard ratio 2.27 [95% confidence interval
1.48-3.47], P < .001; OS 3.69 [2.34-5.84], P < .001). However, multivariate
analysis indicated that its effect was mediated by other risk factors such as
cytogenetics and DS status (EFS 1.45 [0.88-2.39], P = .140; OS 1.90 [1.08-3.36], 
P = .027). Although the outcome of IGH@-CRLF2 patients appeared inferior compared

had a 6-year relapse incidence of 31% plus or minus 8% compared with 11% plus or

attributable to an extremely high incidence of relapse (71% +/- 19%) in

disease not definable as a unique entity. Nevertheless, 62% (33/53) of the DS-ALL
samples analyzed were characterized by high expression of the type I cytokine
receptor CRLF2 caused by either immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH@) translocations 
or by interstitial deletions creating chimeric transcripts P2RY8-CRLF2. In 3 of
these 33 patients, a novel activating somatic mutation, F232C in CRLF2, was
identified. Consistent with our previous research, mutations in R683 of JAK2 were
identified in 10 specimens (19% of the patients) and, interestingly, all 10 had
high CRLF2 expression. Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and mutated Janus 
kinase 2 (Jak2) cooperated in conferring cytokine-independent growth to BaF3
pro-B cells. Intriguingly, the gene expression signature of DS-ALL is enriched
with DNA damage and BCL6 responsive genes, suggesting the possibility of B-cell
lymphocytic genomic instability. Thus, DS confers increased risk for genetically 
highly diverse ALLs with frequent overexpression of CRLF2, associated with
activating mutations in the receptor itself or in JAK2. Our data also suggest
that the majority of DS children with ALL may benefit from therapy blocking the

Marseille Cedex 5, France.","BACKGROUND: Mental retardation (MR) affects 2-3% of the human population and some
of these cases are genetically determined. Although several genes responsible for
MR have been identified, many cases have still not been explained.
METHODS: We have identified a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome
inv(X)(p22.3;q13.2) segregating in a family where two male carriers have severe
MR while female carriers are not affected.
RESULTS: The molecular characterisation of this inversion led us to identify two 
new genes which are disrupted by the breakpoints: KIAA2022 in Xq13.2 and P2RY8 in
Xp22.3. These genes were not previously fully characterised in humans. KIAA2022
encodes a protein which lacks significant homology to any other known protein and
is highly expressed in the brain. P2RY8 is a member of the purine nucleotide
G-protein coupled receptor gene family. It is located in the pseudo-autosomal
region of the X chromosome and is not expressed in brain.
CONCLUSIONS: Because the haploinsufficiency of P2RY8 in carrier mothers does not 
have a phenotypic consequence, we propose that the severe MR of the affected
males in this family is due to the absence of the KIAA2022 gene product. However,
screening 20 probands from X linked MR families did not reveal mutations in
KIAA2022. Nonetheless, the high expression of this gene in fetal brain and in the
adult cerebral cortex could be consistent with a role in brain development and/or
cognitive function.","DOI: 10.1136/jmg.2004.021626

nervous system, and a signaling molecule in non-neural tissue, acting either via 
ligand-gated ion channels (P2X) or G-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y). ATP can
cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) in embryonic cells and so
regulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. We have isolated a
Xenopus cDNA encoding a novel P2Y receptor, XlP2Y, which is expressed abundantly 
in developing embryos. Recombinant XlP2Y responds equally to all five naturally
occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP, and ITP), which elicit a 
biphasic Ca2+-dependent Cl- current (ICl,Ca) where the second phase persists for 
up to 60 min. XlP2Y also causes a continuous release of Ca2+i and a low level
persistent activation of ICl,Ca in Xenopus oocytes through the spontaneous efflux
of ATP. mRNAs for XlP2Y are expressed transiently in the neural plate and tailbud
during Xenopus development, coincident with neurogenesis. This restricted pattern
of expression and novel pharmacological features confer unique properties to
XlP2Y, which may play a key role in the early development of neural tissue.","DOI: 10.1074/jbc.272.19.12583
